# virtualmin-notes
Virtualmin plugin for keeping notes

This is a Virtualmin plugin (which is a Webmin module with some meta data and methods to integrate it with Virtualmin) that provides a simple UI for leaving notes on the dashboard for yourself or other administrators. It's also probably a pretty good "first plugin" to look  at because it does almost nothing, and ties into the virtualmin UI.

# Installation

If you just want to use it, install it from the Virtualmin softare repositories:

CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/yum/dnf

```bash
# yum install wbm-virtualmin-notes
```

Debian/Ubuntu/apt

```bash
# apt-get update; apt-get install webmin-virtualmin-notes
```

Others, grab the .wbm from https://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/wbm and install it using the Webmin Modules module.
